## ⚠️ Requires Manual Action

### 1. Google Cloud Console — CRITICAL
Add these two entries to your OAuth 2.0 Client:

**Authorized JavaScript origins:**
```
https://personal-os-coral-tau.vercel.app
```

**Authorized redirect URIs:**
```
https://personal-os-coral-tau.vercel.app
https://personal-os-coral-tau.vercel.app/api/google-callback
```

→ https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

### 2. Vercel Environment Variables
See `docs/SETUP.md` for the full list. Critical ones:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — already set
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` — already set
- `TWILIO_SID` / `TWILIO_TOKEN` / `TWILIO_FROM` — for WhatsApp
- `CRON_SECRET` — for job hunt cron security

### 3. Gmail OAuth Scope
The Calendar connect button now also requests `gmail.send` scope. When clicking Calendar for the first time, Google will ask permission for both Calendar and Gmail. Accept both.

## Wire-up Fixes — Round 4
**Date:** 2026-05-01  
**Session:** Claude Opus 4.7  

### Root cause of the failed deploy

Commit `c326b7f` pushed 14 serverless functions. The Vercel Hobby plan caps at **12 functions**. Five of those files were dead-code stubs — their own comments said they were placeholders that the frontend never called:

- `api/jobs/list.js` — "Use localStorage as primary store. This endpoint reserved for future..."
- `api/jobs/create.js` — same family, never routed
- `api/jobs/update.js` — same
- `api/jobs/delete.js` — same
- `api/email/send.js` — "kept as a server-side option if a service account is needed"

**Fix:** deleted all five. Function count: 14 → **9** (well within the limit). The failing deploy resolved immediately after push.

### Function count verification (post-fix)

```
api/claude.js
api/cron/job-hunt.js
api/fetch-page.js
api/google-callback.js
api/log-error.js
api/match-score.js
api/search.js
api/webhook.js
api/whatsapp/send.js

Total: 9 ≤ 12 ✓
```

### What was wired up (Steps 1–6)

| Step | Fix | How |
|------|-----|-----|
| Step 0 | Deploy unblocked | Deleted 5 dead-code API stubs, function count 14→9 |
| Step 1 | Sidebar "+ פרויקט" button | Added button calling `openAddProjectModal()` under the פרויקטים section header |
| Step 2 | Hebrew name garbled (`□×□×§×`) | `atob()` returns a binary string; Hebrew UTF-8 bytes were misinterpreted as Latin-1. Fixed with `decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(b64)))` |
| Step 3 | Profile setup modal not firing for returning users | Changed `if(isNew)` → `if(isNew \|\| !S.userProfile?.name)` so the modal also appears when a returning user has no name saved |
| Step 4 | 🎙 Live buttons missing from chat headers | `addLiveVoiceBtns()` used querySelector selectors that didn't match the actual onclick attributes — no buttons ever appeared. Replaced with static HTML buttons in all 7 chat headers (main, job-hunter, career-coach, upselles, health, family, ideas). Removed the broken dynamic-insertion code. |
| Step 5 | Mobile bottom nav obscures last card | Added `padding-bottom:74px` to `.main` at `@media(max-width:768px)` so content doesn't hide behind the fixed 5-tab bar |
| Step 6 | FedCM console errors on sign-in | Added `data-use_fedcm_for_prompt="true"` and `data-cancel_on_tap_outside="false"` to the `g_id_onload` div. The `.g_id_signin` button remains as a reliable visible fallback. |

### What is still not verified in browser

Steps 2–6 require a live sign-in or mobile device to verify visually. The code changes are correct but browser confirmation was not performed in this session (no browser automation available). Treat the deploy as "code correct, awaiting manual smoke-test."

### Commits in this round

```
920d49f  fix(deploy): remove 5 dead-code API stubs (Step 0)
f09ff72  feat(sidebar): add + פרויקט button (Step 1)
0f60f72  fix(auth): decode JWT as UTF-8 — Hebrew name fix (Step 2)
9be2f9e  fix(profile): modal trigger for returning users (Step 3)
21517f7  feat(voice): hardcode 🎙 Live in 7 chat headers (Step 4)
752d8e0  fix(mobile): padding-bottom for bottom nav (Step 5)
8cd4f38  fix(auth): FedCM opt-in + cancel_on_tap_outside=false (Step 6)
```

## Platform v3.0 — Multi-User Onboarding + Template System
**Date:** 2026-05-01  
**Session:** Claude Opus 4.7  
**Commit:** `bad2c9e` — +540 lines, -123 lines  
**Deploy:** HTTP 200, Content-Length 255923, Last-Modified Fri 01 May 2026 20:04:51

### What was built

#### Phase 1 — New user onboarding ✅
- Full-screen overlay (`#onb-overlay`) shown after Google sign-in when `!S.userProfile.onboardingComplete`
- Step 1: name input + 6 primary-goal cards (חיפוש עבודה, עסק/סטארטאפ, כספים, כושר, דירה, מאורגן)
- "דלג" → sets `onboardingComplete=true`, lands on dashboard with hint
- "המשך" → saves name+goal to `S.userProfile`, opens template gallery (Step 2)
- Roei (`tklroei1@gmail.com`) always bypasses onboarding — `onboardingComplete=true` set on sign-in

#### Phase 2 — Template library + project creator ✅
- `+פרויקט` sidebar button now opens a full gallery modal (7 template cards)
- Filter chips: הכל / עבודה / כספים / בריאות / כלים / אחר
- **Built-in templates** (job search, finance, fitness, apartment, family, startup) navigate to existing hardcoded pages — zero rebuild, zero regression risk
- **Custom projects**: create dynamic pages injected into `#main` + dynamic nav items under `#tmpl-nav-items`
- `loadDynProjects()` called at `init()` to restore dynamic nav+pages on reload from `S.projects`
- "✨ בנה בעצמך" → opens builder directly

#### Phase 3 — D&D project builder ✅
- Full-screen overlay builder with 10-widget library (left panel) + canvas (right panel)
- HTML5 drag API from library → canvas; SortableJS reorder within canvas
- Per-widget delete button (✕)
- "שמור" → persists `widget[]` array to `S.projects[].widgets`, closes builder
- "תצוגה מקדימה" → navigates to the project page
- New project from builder: modal → name → create → navigate

#### Finance v2 — Rebuilt properly ✅ (old page removed)
- **4 summary cards**: income, expenses, balance, savings % (color-coded green/amber/red)
- **SVG donut pie chart** — pure JS, no external chart library; shows expense breakdown by category with legend + percentages
- **Budget bars** — 14 preset categories (שכירות, סופר, קפה, מסעדות…) with actual-vs-budget bar + overspend warning (⚠️)
- **Monthly trend** — 6-month bar charts for expenses AND income (CSS flex bars)
- **AI insight** button on trend tab → calls `/api/claude`
- Category chips update between expense/income mode
- All existing `S.finance` data preserved (same storage, compatible category names)

### What was skipped / noted
- `templates/` directory files — template manifests inlined in `index.html` (simpler, avoids adding new static files to vercel routing)
- `js/` split files — same reason (Vercel needs explicit static file routes)
- Widget renderers for dynamic projects — canvas shows "add widgets" CTA; widgets saved as config but not yet rendered as functional UI (that's the next build phase)
- `genFinInsight()` (old function) — dead code, remains in file but unreachable; new equivalent is `fin2Insight()`

### API function count (unchanged)
```
9 functions ≤ 12 Hobby limit ✓
```

### curl verification
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Age: 0
Content-Length: 255923
Last-Modified: Fri, 01 May 2026 20:04:51 GMT
```

### Honest caveats
- Onboarding, template gallery, and builder require browser testing with a real Google sign-in (new account) to verify visual flow — not possible in this headless session
- Dynamic project widget rendering (showing actual charts/lists inside a created project) is deferred to the next build cycle
- Roei's existing projects (jobs/upselles/health/apartment/family/finance/notes) are fully preserved and unchanged
